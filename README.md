# Simple_Scripts 001


One of the best ways to backup a MySQL RDS instance using mysqldump is to use the mysqldump command in a shell script that runs on a schedule. Here's an example of a simple shell script that you can use to backup a MySQL RDS instance:

You can then use cron to schedule this script to run at a specific interval.

Here are some points to keep in mind when using mysqldump to backup RDS databases:

    * mysqldump creates a consistent backup by temporarily locking tables. So, while the backup is running, it might cause some inconvenience for writes to the database.
    * Large table can cause the dump process to run for a long time, depending on the size of the table and available memory, also it may cause high CPU or I/O loads on the RDS instance.
    * If your database is large, you might want to split the dump into smaller chunks to reduce the impact on your RDS instance and make sure that the dump process completes within the maintenance window.
    * To minimize the impact on production load, you should perform the backups during periods of low database activity.

AWS RDS also provides a built-in method to take backup of your RDS instance by creating a point-in-time snapshots of your RDS instances, which can be automated and scheduled as per your requirements.
